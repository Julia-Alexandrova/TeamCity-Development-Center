TeamCity build system consists of two parts:

1. The server that gathers information while builds are running
2. Agents that run builds and send information to the server

Consequently, depending on where the code runs, there are 
- server-side and 
- agent-side plugins.

From the point of view of functionality,TeamCity plugins can be divided into:

- Build runners
- VCS plugins
- Notifiers
- User authentication plugins
- Build Triggers
- Extensions
